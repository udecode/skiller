## Documentation

### README.md Fork Features Section

The fork features section at the top of README.md documents `skiller` additions:

- **Stay concise**: Bullet points only, no verbose explanations
- **Be factual**: No marketing language or unnecessary justifications
- **Format**: Use `##` for feature numbers, `-` for bullet points
- **Code examples**: Only when essential for clarity
- **No proof needed**: State features directly without proving their value

## Development Process

### Testing

- Always follow TDD where possible - first adding or adjusting tests, verifying that they fail, then making the minimal changes to pass the tests.
- Everything in this repository should be covered by tests. That always includes:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests

### Code Formatting

- Always ensure that the code is formatted correctly by running prettier before committing changes.

### Branches and Pull Requests

- **CRITICAL: Always create PRs against `udecode/skiller`**, never against `origin` or any other fork. Use `gh pr create --repo udecode/skiller` to ensure the PR targets the correct repository.
- Unless specifically instructed otherwise, all changes should be made in a feature branch and submitted as a pull request for review.
- Pull requests should be descriptive and clearly explain the changes being made, including the rationale behind the change, the functional changes, the specific files and modules affected.
- Before declaring a pull request ready for review, you must ensure that all the CI tests pass. These include:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run build`
- IMPORTANT: Before committing, always use Prettier to ensure that the code is formatted correctly.
- IMPORTANT: When committing yourself with `git commit`, always pass `--author="AI <skiller+ai@okigu.com>"` so that your commits can be easily identified.
